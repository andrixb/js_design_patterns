# js_design_patterns
Repo used to host working examples of JS (ES5) design patterns (each pattern is in a separate branch)

It is used to show code example in this GitBook https://www.gitbook.com/book/pietropassarelli/design-patterns-study-group

## Collaborate
If you want to implement a pattern please keep to the following naming convention when it comes to branch creations:

`CHAPTER-NAME/DPName`

i.e. `FURTHER-DP-FOR-JS/Module`
